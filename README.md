# 🍔 Full Stack UberEats Clone

This project is a fully functional **UberEats Clone** mobile app developed using **React Native** and **Appwrite**, built during the [JavaScript Mastery](https://jsmastery.pro/) course. It showcases a production-ready architecture designed for seamless food delivery experiences on both iOS and Android.

Created and taught by Adrian Hajdin at JavaScript Mastery, this project covers the entire lifecycle of a scalable mobile app — from authentication and search filtering to cart functionality and database architecture.
